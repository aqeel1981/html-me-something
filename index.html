                    <b>Liverpool Football Club</b> is a professional soccer club in Liverpool, England, that competes in the Premier 
                    League, the top tier of English football. It is my favourite soccer team in the world and they have won six European Cups, more than any other English club, 
                    three UEFA Cups and four UEFA Super Cups, also English records, eighteen League titles, seven FA Cups, a record 
                    eight League Cups and fifteen FA Community Shields.

                    Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its formation.
                    Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly,
                    Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish led the club to a combined eleven League titles and four European Cups. Under 
                    the management of Rafael Benítez and captained by homegrown player Steven Gerrard, Liverpool became European champions for
                    the fifth time in 2005, before a sixth title was added under Jürgen Klopp in 2019.

                <h3>Revenue and Fanbase</h3>
                <p>
                    Liverpool was the seventh highest-earning football club in the world in 2019, with an annual revenue of €513.7.2 million, and the world's eighth most valuable
                    football club in 2019, valued at $2.183 billion. The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world. Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with
                    Manchester United and Everton. Liverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially 
                    recognised Club of the LFC Official Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly. The club takes advantage of this support through 
                    its worldwide summer tours, which has included playing in front of 101,000 in Michigan, U.S., and 95,000 in Melbourne, Australia. Liverpool fans often refer to
                    themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, 
                    to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.

                    The song <em>"You'll Never Walk Alone"</em>, originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry and the Pacemakers, is 
                    the club's anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s. It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world. The song's 
                    title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The "You'll Never Walk Alone" portion of the 
                    Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club's crest.
